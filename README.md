 In this project we are going to use Regression for the prediction of IPL First Innings Score based on the several features available in the datasets.

step 1 : Firstly we will try to select some of the important features from the dataset so that it can help us to predict the car prices more accurately.

step 2 : Then we will perform feature engineering on the selected feaures also removing outliers and then making the dummy variables for the category features.

step 3 : We will then going to apply the machine Learning Algorithm of Support vector Machine.

step 4 : Based on the trained models we can simply preict the new datapoint for the IPL first innigs Score based on the current Situation.

step 5 : Then we will pickle the model for the later on usage.

step 6 : We have made an interactive web application for this using Flask framework.
